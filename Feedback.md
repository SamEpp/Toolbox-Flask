Comments on Tool Box:
Geocoding: I enjoyed this toolbox. I thought it a really useful one to do before the final project! I thought the information was well structured and thought it was challenging, I thought it was a fun tool box to complete.

Machine Learning: The change in formatting for this toolbox threw me off at first. I disliked having to write answers to the questions. I didn't feel like they improved my understanding of the concepts and I would rather have done some more extensive programming. I also would have liked to been able to submit pictures of the graphs I made (mostly because I was proud of them).

Pickling: I thought this was a good toolbox. It was important to me because it showed me another way how pickling can be used. The context of the toolbox was quite different than the type of pickling used in the mini project. In addition this toolbox thoroughly explained why I had to do certain lines of code (this explained retroactively what I had done in the MP)

Word Frequency: This toolbox was pretty easy (which was good because I did it when I felt like I needed a break). It reminded me of the pickling toolbox, as in this presented a similar challenge as a MP but the context and structuring of the resources still allowed me to get a lot of knowledge out of doing the toolbox. It also gave me an introduction to achieving the same thing in different ways. Whenever we code there are dozens of ways to approach the same problem. This toolbox had me  reapproach a problem from a new angle which gave me new perspective on what code can do.

Unit Testing: This toolbox taught me about good code “health” as in I tried to have “good” code practices while writing the program. I would have appreciated a repository, or a heads up that there wasn’t a repository because that initially through me through a loop. 

Flask: This toolbox was a lot of fun. I had some difficulties with syntax, however everything else went pretty smoothly. I thought that the initial structure was good, however after the introduction of templates I began noticing some typos. I also had a difficult time with the Flask documentation but overall I was proud of my work. I think this should be pushed harder to be done  before final projects. In addition I think this would work well as a Reading Journal (it should probably count as 2).
